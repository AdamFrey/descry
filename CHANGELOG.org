** 0.1.0-master-0002
- Allow for setting options to exclude certain attributes from output,
  with the ~exclude-attributes~ option. This is helpful for when you
  have an attribute that holds a large amount of text, for example.

** 0.1.0-master-0001
- Descry opens a simple window with a table displaying the datascript
  entities. Ugly as sin and basically unhelpful right now.
